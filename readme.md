### Testing User Stories from User Experience Section

### Users Stories
-   #### First Time Visitor Goals

    1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site.

        1. Upon landing on the main page users are greeted with a clean site whose imagery and text convey a message that the sites primary goal revolves around writing and storytelling.
        

    2. As a First Time Visitor, I would like to browse the sites content without signing up or logging in.

        1. The site has been designed to give a good and unimpeded flow from start to end.
        2. The sites categories and most of its content are freely availible to unregistered users. 


    
-   #### Returning Visitor Goals

    1. As a Returning Visitor, I would like create my own login profile to allow me create content.

        1. A returning visitor to the site can choose the 'Signup' button or 'Login' from the main navigation menu. From here they are invited to complete the signup process.

    
    2. As a Returning Visitor, I would like to easily connect with the sites social media channels.

        1. A returning visitor can use the social media links at the bottom of the page to connect with a larger audience.

-   #### Frequent User Goals

    1. As a Frequent Visitor, I would like create another short story.

        1. The user first needs a valid logon. Once logged in they can go to their profile page and choose the 'Create New' button. They then shoose a category for their story along with a public or private setting, lastly when they are finshed writing, they can submit the short story by clicking the 'Submit' button. 
        
    2. As a Frequent Visitor, I would like read back over one of my recently added short stories.

        1. The user in this case can be either logged in or not. From here they can browse the caterogries and find their story, or if they do login they cna view their work from within the profile.

    3. As a Frequent Visitor, I would like edit one of my recently added short stories.

        1. The user will need to be logged in for this task also, once logged in they can go to their profile page, locate the peice of work that there interested in changing and choose the edit function, once happy with the changes they can click the 'Submit' button.
    
    4. As a Frequent Visitor, I would like remove one of my recently added short stories.

        1. The user again will need to be logged in for this task. From here they can go to their profile page, locate the peice of work that there interested in and choose the delete button to remove it.

### Known Bugs

## Deployment

The project was deployed using the steps below.

### GitHub

1. Firstly we log on to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and choose 'new' in the top left corner to create a public repository using the 'Code Institute' template.
2. From there we choose the The_Write_Way repository and main screen clcik the 'GitPod' to launch it.

### GitPod

1. The Gitpod workspace takes a few minutes to build and once it launches. Its best to go to [GitPod Workspaces](https://gitpod.io/workspaces/) and select the 3 vertical dots next to the workspace. These are the settings for the workspace, we just need to choose 'Pin' so that the workspace is not automatically removed after 14 days.
2. After we have made an inital change to the new workspace we can go ahead and make an intial commit to our GitHub repository to test that its working.
- git add .
- git commit -m "initial commit"
- git push
3. Next we needed to setup the environment, and we do this by installing the components below at the terminal.
- Sets up Flask > pip3 install Flask
- Create my main python file > touch run.py
- Creates the environmental variables file > touch env.py
- Inside the env.py we need to add the following values, in order to successfull connect to MongoDb created earlier 
    import os                                                               (Imports the os module)

    os.environ.setdefault("IP", "0.0.0.0")                                  (Configure the Ip range)
    os.environ.setdefault("PORT", "5000")                                   (Use the default flask Port)
    os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "AA22CA3FA237B79E36635A42EA818")    (generated my own unique key from https://randomkeygen.com/)
    os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_URI", "mongodb+srv://admin:r00tUser@cluster0.dhqoa.mongodb.net/theWriteWay?retryWrites=true&w=majority")                                           (put in our mongo uri that we configured earlier for secure authentication)
    os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_DBNAME", "theWriteWay")                    (sets up the database name tha was created earlier)
- Then we need to call the import from the top of our python file by saying if the if the env.py path exists import it.
